I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech,advised by [Prof. Kong James](https://www.ise.vt.edu/people/faculty/kong.html). I obtained my undergraduate in the Systems Engineering Department at City University of Hong Kong, advised by  [Prof. Liu Cheng](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/ChengLiu.htm). My research focuses on structural health monitoring in civil infrastructure using digital twin technologies.

In the summer of 2024, I conducted research at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, focusing on embodied AI under the supervision of [Prof. Pang Zhibo](https://www.kth.se/profile/zhibo).
