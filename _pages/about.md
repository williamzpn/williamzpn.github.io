I am an incoming Ph.D. student (2025) in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech. I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Systems Engineering Department at City University of Hong Kong, advised by  [Prof. Liu Cheng](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/stfprofile/ChengLiu.htm). My research focuses on structural health monitoring in civil infrastructure using digital twin technologies.

In the summer of 2024, I conducted research at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, focusing on embodied AI under the supervision of [Prof. Pang Zhibo](https://www.kth.se/profile/zhibo).
